While monotremes are the true mammals of the south, marsupials only ended up there after first evolving in the northern hemisphere. Much later, the splitting of continents produced three branches of placental mammals: an African group (”Afrotheria”, which includes elephants, aardvarks, and golden moles), a South American contingent (”Xenarthra”: the sloths, anteaters, and armadillos), and a North American/Eurasian bunch (”Boreoeutheria”, which includes rodents, primates, carnivores, bats, and more.", "Although that's the end of our brief tour of mammals, all these groups and much more can be explored on our tree of life simply by closing this window."]
